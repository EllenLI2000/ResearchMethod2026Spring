# Temporal Selves Chat

This repository contains a web-based prototype that allows participants to:

1. **Define a Past Self and a Future Self**
2. **Chat with each self as a separate conversational agent**
3. **Reflect on differences between the two conversations**

The overall interaction flow is fixed, while **content, framing, and wording are customizable**.

---

## App Flow (Do Not Change)

The app always follows this sequence:

1. **Customize**
   - Participants define a *Past Self* and a *Future Self*
   - Each self includes:
     - Name
     - Age (optional)
     - Short bio
     - Description

2. **Chat**
   - Participants chat separately with:
     - their Past Self
     - their Future Self
   - Each self responds based on the description written in the first step

3. **Reflection**
   - Participants answer reflection questions after chatting

⚠️ **Do not change the order or remove any step.**
