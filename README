Temporal Selves Chat

This repository contains a web-based prototype that allows participants to:

Define a Past Self and a Future Self

Chat with each self as a separate conversational agent

Reflect on differences between the two conversations

The overall interaction flow is fixed, while content, framing, and wording are customizable.

App Flow (Do Not Change)

The app always follows this sequence:

Customize

Participants define a Past Self and a Future Self

Each self includes:

Name

Age (optional)

Short bio

Description

Chat

Participants chat separately with:

Past Self

Future Self

Each self responds based on the descriptions written in the first step

Reflection

Participants answer reflection questions after chatting

⚠️ Do not change the order or remove any step.

Getting Started
1. Fork the repository

Click Fork on GitHub and work from your own copy.

2. Install dependencies

From the repository root, run:

npm install

3. Set up the API key

Create a file called .env.local in the repository root with the following content:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Do not commit this file

The app will not work without a valid API key and available credit

4. Run the app
npm run dev


Then open:

http://localhost:3000

What You Can Customize

Throughout the codebase, you will see comments marked:

STUDENT-EDITABLE ZONE

These indicate places where you can safely make changes.

Typical customization points include:

Page titles and explanatory text

Field labels and placeholder wording

How the Past Self and Future Self are framed

The tone and guidance rules used in the chat (safeguards)

Reflection questions shown after the chat

Which fields are required vs. optional

You are encouraged to adapt wording, framing, and prompts.

What You Should NOT Change

To keep the system functional, do not:

Remove either the Past Self or the Future Self

Merge the two chats into one conversation

Change the page order (Customize → Chat → Reflection)

Remove the safeguard layer in the chat prompts

Modify the API route unless you know what you are doing

If something breaks, first revert changes outside the editable zones.

Notes on Chat Behavior

The Past Self and Future Self are implemented as two distinct conversational agents

Each agent is shaped by:

the participant-written short bio

the longer description

a built-in safeguard layer that encourages supportive, constructive responses

Responses are not intended as professional, medical, or therapeutic advice

Deployment (Optional)

If you want to share this app with participants:

You can deploy it using Vercel or a similar service

Store the API key as an environment variable on the server

Be aware that each chat message uses the OpenAI API and may incur cost

Data & Privacy

By default:

Data is stored locally in the participant’s browser

No login or authentication is required

No personally identifiable information is enforced

If you plan to collect or export data, you are responsible for handling consent and storage appropriately.

Troubleshooting

App does not start → Check Node version (Node ≥ 18 required)

Chat replies fail → Check API key validity and account credit

Layout breaks after editing → Revert changes outside editable zones

Summary

This repository provides:

A ready-to-run prototype

Clear customization points

A stable interaction structure

Use it as a base and adapt the content and framing, not the core flow.
